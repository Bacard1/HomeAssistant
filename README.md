This repository showcases my "Home Assistant" project, broken down into modules and presented as individual mini-projects. Some of these can be used both with and without Home Assistant.

Here you’ll find a brief description of the idea, purpose, and advantages of each project. If you find any of them interesting, you can follow the link below each description to access the full project.
