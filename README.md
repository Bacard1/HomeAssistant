## 💬 Tittle

- **Dynamism:** All objects and texts must be able to automatically scales depending on the size of the screen or window, maintaining a convenient view within the permissible limits.
- **Simplified and tight design:** Easy to understand by both adults and children.Including quick links to key features and information to reduce pages links offset by pop-up windows for better navigation.
- **Resources optimization:**
- Reducing the cost of resources in the household through automation.
- Creating convenience and unobtrusive interaction for the occupants.
- **Construction of a management structure:** Separation of zones and grouping sensors, lighting and switches for ease in automation.Introducing a hierarchy for better group organization.
- **Security:** Using available home protection devices when there is no one in it.
- **Parental Control:**
- Access to location information on mobile devices.
- Control over access and use of computers by children.
- **Information:** Notification to all household members for important events.
- **Integration of electrical appliances:** Striving to integrate the available equipment without the need for replacement as far as possible.
- **Independence:** Everything has to work without internet access.
